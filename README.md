# OneSimpleOsc
OSO is One Simple Oscilator. It currently needs 2*ENV, 2*LFO, Wave manipulation, Harmonic manipulation, Detune,... (etc)

It must cover everything a synth covers (eg: serum, sylenth) using only one oscilator. It can be used in a Vst Host App to add more than one oscilator in play

#Building from source
Make sure to add the Maximilian framework (Eg: LinuxMakeFile -> Debug:Header Search Paths = "/path/to/maxi")
Drag and drop the framework folder to the source folder (in projucer)
